# H13 Pixel Framebuffer Simulation

_**NOTICE:** This project isn't fully-baked yet. It should be considered somebody else's playground until I nail down enough of it to claim with a straight face that it has an API._

H13 is a simple graphics library that handles the finicky parts of drawing a simple TrueColor pixel grid to the screen. All you have to do is edit an array of color values, and H13 will render it for you.

H13 is named after the much-beloved 320x200x256 VGA/MCGA graphics mode known to BIOS as mode 13h and known to QBASIC as SCREEN 13.
