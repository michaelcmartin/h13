Alternate approaches to embedding the library:
  [X] dev manages event loop, calls into the render/init routines on their own
  [ ] Library manages event loop, calls dev-provided init/update loop
      [ ] API for keyboard/mouse input
      [ ] Typeahead text buffer independent of raw keypress events
  [ ] User runs in a worker thread and offers potential sync points for rendering

Alternate backends:
  [X] SDL2-OpenGL 3.2
  [X] SDL2-OpenGL 2.1
  [ ] Direct3D (9? 11? 12?)
  [ ] Metal

Frontend support:
  [ ] Text rendering
  [ ] Screen-native-res debug console
  [ ] Nonsquare pixels
